## üìú Agenda of the meeting

- Determine the objectives of each person in sprint1, form a commonly agreed task list 
- Determine the process for follow up meetings as well as the project specification github project management


## üó£Ô∏è Discussion points and decision-making

### 1. Core Functional Design

Core Value: Helping development teams quantify and visualise their Agile development process
Data visualisation icon generation: burndown charts; cumulative flow charts; trend charts; etc;
Other features that need to be added will be discussed later depending on the development progress.
### 2.Sprint1Ôºàweek2-5Ôºâ Issue
- *Develop user stories (including description of both functional and non-functional requirements), sketch the architecture to address non-functional requirements, set up baselines for code/test/review, and identify/track/resolve technical debts
- *Set up your GitHub project to track the progress.* 
Backend 1: Research GitHub API, complete data extraction and delivery; (2point)
Backend 2: Design story point extraction rules, complete the burndown chart data calculation algorithm.(2point)
Front-end: research environment dependencies, and be able to generate static images locally.(2point)
Documentation: Create a project documentation catalogue to record technical decisions (e.g. API selection, story point format); write user stories.(1point)
Testing: Familiarise yourself with the project and prepare for writing subsequent unit tests.(1point)
PM: Create a GitHub Project Kanban board to enter the above tasks. Generate the first version of the burndown chart, write the meeting minutes and push;(2point)

### 3.story point or man-hours
- *If an average programmer takes 3 man-hours to complete a task, and a specific programmer S takes 10 hours to deliver it. S should only be credited with 3 man-hours.* 
- *Ensure your team sets up the principle upfront and agree on it.*
- *Rather than using man-hours, a team may choose to Story Point of a task. E.g., 3 points for a task, irrespective to whether S spent 3 hours or 30 hours to complete it.*
- *Break down a large task into smaller tasks before estimation*
- *Estimate and gain consensus before task (re-)assignment* 
After some discussion we chose to use story pointÔºå
30-40 hours total work per person; 
1 story point = 3 hours average work; 
at least 10 points per person
### 4.milestone
- Sprint 1 (Weeks 2-5): Foundation and Core 
	Goal: Fork the original project, build the environment, implement the most core 1-2 new features, and demonstrate technical feasibility.
- Sprint 2 (Weeks 6-9): Core enhancements 
	Goal: Deliver the most valuable new features.
	Activities in Sprint 1 + code quality + improved the baseline 
- Sprint 3 (Weeks 10-13): Optimise, test and deliver 
	Goal: Improve features, test and prepare final deliverables.
	Activities in Sprint 2 + automated testing/debugging/maintenance support 
	Video clip (for presentation and demo) + final report + Github invite
### 5. Follow-up meeting process
 - Sprint planning phase: sprint goal document, sprint backlog 
-  Sprint execution phase: each member takes turns to report on the work, sort out problems encountered, and count what has been done; Determine what is to be done in the week 
 - Sprint review phase: internal team presentations to gather feedback
