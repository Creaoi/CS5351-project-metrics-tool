**Wang Jingchu (Backend)**:

- Processed and split data for the burndown chart into daily metrics.
- Delivered final data files to frontend; will refactor and integrate code into the main project.

**Li Muyu (Documentation)**:

- Outlined the project report structure based on course requirements.
- Requested that all developers share references (e.g., APIs, methods) for the "Related Work" section.
- Will include testing use cases and approaches once available.
- Offered frontend component library recommendations (e.g., Ant Design for Vue).

**Zhang Lin (Testing)**:

- Familiarized with the project and original test cases.
- Awaiting functional deliverables from development to begin formal testing.

### 2. Decisions and Action Items

- **Zhang Lin's Invitation**: Wen Peixuan to resolve the GitHub invitation issue offline.
- **Base Code Upload**: Liang Dasi to ensure v0.1 code is uploaded to GitHub for branching.
- **Frontend Improvements**: Chen Ting to explore Vue-compatible component libraries (e.g., Ant Design) for UI enhancements.
- **Backend Integration**: Wang Jingchu to refactor and merge burndown chart code into the main repository.
- **Documentation Collaboration**:

    - All developers to share reference materials with Li Muyu for inclusion in the project report.

    - Li Muyu to upload the report framework to GitHub (as MD files) in the designated folder.
 
- **Testing Preparation**: Zhang Lin to begin drafting test cases once development deliverables are available.
### 3. Next Week Planning

- **Development**: Complete coding and prepare for testing (burndown chart feature).
- **Frontend**: Integrate backend data and refine UI using component libraries.
- **Backend**: Finalize and integrate data processing modules.
- **Documentation**: Expand report sections based on developer inputs.
- **Testing**: Formalize test cases and begin validation once features are delivered.

### 4. Follow-up Process

- Continue weekly progress updates and issue resolution during meetings.
- Use GitHub Projects for task tracking and collaboration.
- Ensure all documentation and code are synchronized and accessible via GitHub.
