## Discussion points and decision-making

### 1. Sprint 2 Feature Proposal and Selection

Multiple feature proposals were discussed for Sprint 2, focusing on enhancing project metrics and visualization:

**Liang Dasi proposed three features related to team efficiency and contribution:**
1.  **Member Contribution Activity**: Visualize the number of completed issues or story points per contributor.
2.  **Issue Response Time**: Analyze the time taken from an issue's creation to its completion.
3.  **Code Review Efficiency**: Measure the average time from code submission (pull request) to merger.

**Wang Jingchu proposed features related to issue and commit patterns:**
1.  **Issue Creation Frequency Distribution**: A histogram showing the preferred days of the week for creating issues.
2.  **Daily/Weekly Commit Count Trend**: A line chart displaying the fluctuation in commit numbers over time.

**Decision**:
- All proposed features will be added to the GitHub project Kanban board.
- The team will prioritize implementation based on available time during the sprint. The backend features proposed by Liang Dasi were implicitly set as the initial focus.

### 2. Task Estimation and Assignment

**Backend Development (Liang Dasi & Wang Jingchu)**:
- Each of the three primary backend features (Contribution, Response Time, Review Efficiency) is estimated at **1-2 story points**.
- The two backend developers will internally allocate these specific tasks after the meeting.

**Frontend Development (Chen Ting)**:
- The frontend work will correspond one-to-one with the backend features delivered.
- An additional task to develop a **frontend query interface** (e.g., with search/navigation links) is planned.
- Total frontend effort is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the total backend effort for the implemented features.

**Other Roles (PM, Documentation, Testing)**:
- Tasks for these roles (Wen Peixuan, Li Muyu, Zhang Lin) are considered routine for this sprint and similar to Sprint 1, thus not discussed in detail.

### 3. Other Discussion Points

**Testing Process Clarification (Zhang Lin)**:
- Clarified that test code should be included in the source code, and test results should be documented and shared with the documentation owner (Li Muyu) for inclusion in the final project report.

**Attendance Note (Chen Ting)**:
- Chen Ting will be unavailable for the Week 8 meeting but will provide her progress update to Wen Peixuan in advance.

### 4. Decisions and Action Items

- **Wen Peixuan (PM)**: Update the GitHub Project Kanban board with all proposed Sprint 2 features and their initial story point estimates.
- **Liang Dasi & Wang Jingchu (Backend)**: Finalize task allocation for the backend features among themselves.
- **All Developers**: Begin implementation of assigned Sprint 2 tasks.
- **Zhang Lin (Testing)**: Formalize test cases and integrate testing into the development cycle.
- **Chen Ting (Frontend)**: Provide progress update via chat before the Week 8 meeting.
